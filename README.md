# VoiceBiometric
Voice biometrics identifies specific speakers rather than the words they say. ... Voice biometrics maps a speaker's unique characteristics and then uses the map for later identification. A user provides one or more audio samples, which the system analyzes to create a unique voiceprint for the speaker.
